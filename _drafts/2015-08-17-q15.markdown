Write a C Program to output the sign of an input float number.
On input `a`, you have to output positive, zero or negative

INPUT : a given in a line
OUTPUT: input is zero **OR** a is positive/negative

Use 4 decimal places

##### Test Cases

###### Test Case 1

``` c
Input  : -12
Output : -12.0000 is negative
```

###### Test Case 2

``` c
Input  : 0
Output : input is zero
```

###### Test Case 3

``` c
Input  : 1
Output : 1.0000 is positive
```

###### Note
Observe the spaces given in the output format. When practising at home,
it makes no difference but in the labs, the output should match exactly
as specified in the format.

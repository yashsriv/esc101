## General Rules
Upto 20% marks will be allotted for good programming practice. These
include:

* Comments: for non trivial parts of code
* Indentation: align your code properly

---

Write a C Program to calculate the perimeter of the triangle formed
by the three points `(0, 0)`, `(a, 0)` and `(0, b)`, where the coordinates
are float and given by the user. The output should be rounded to four
decimal places. The exact format should be:

INPUT : a b given in a line
OUTPUT: The perimeter of O, (a, 0) and (0, b) is P

##### Test Cases

###### Test Case 1

``` c
Input  : 1 1
Output : The perimeter of O, (1.0000, 0) and (0, 1.0000) is 3.4142
```

###### Note
Observe the spaces given in the output format. When practising at home,
it makes no difference but in the labs, the output should match exactly
as specified in the format.

## General Rules
Upto 20% marks will be allotted for good programming practice. These
include:

* Comments: for non trivial parts of code
* Indentation: align your code properly

---

Write a C Program to calculate the intersection point of two lines.
All the values are in float.

INPUT : a1 b1 a2 b2 are given in a line. They specify the two lines
(a1X + b1Y = 1) & (a2X + b2Y = 1)
OUTPUT: If there is no intersection point, the print "INF" else print
the intersection point upto 3 decimal places

##### Test Cases

###### Test Case 1

``` c
Input  : 1 1 1 0.5
Output : (1.000, 0.000)
```

###### Test Case 2

``` c
Input  : 1 0 0 1
Output : (0.000, 0.000)
```

###### Test Case 3

``` c
Input  : 1 0 1 0
Output : INF
```

###### Test Case 4

``` c
Input  : 1 0 2 0
Output : INF
```

###### Note
Observe the spaces given in the output format. When practising at home,
it makes no difference but in the labs, the output should match exactly
as specified in the format.

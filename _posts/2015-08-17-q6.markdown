earn some interest on it. Write a program to calculate the total
amount that Dennis will get after application of Simple Interest.
Formula to calculate how much Dennis gets if he deposits `P` Rupees
for `T` years at `R` rate of interest is given by:

```
Amount = P(1 + TR/100)
```

Your program should input `P` followed by `T` followed by `R`.
All values are of type `float`. Output value of `Amount` rounded
upto three decimal places.

## General Rules
Upto 20% marks will be allotted for good programming practice. These
include:

* Comments: for non trivial parts of code
* Indentation: align your code properly

---

Write a C Program to calculate the distance between two points
`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, where the coordinates are float and
are given by the user.

The formula for distance is:

```
√ ((x1−x2)²+(y1−y2)² )
```

You can calculate the square-root of `X` by calling the function
`sqrtf(X)`. The result is in float.

INPUT Format : x1 y1 x2 y2 are given, with spaces, in this sequence in a line.
OUTPUT Format: The distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is D

`D` should be rounded off to 3 decimal places.

##### Test Cases

###### Test Case 1

``` c
Input  : 0 1 1 0
Output : The distance between (0.000, 1.000) and (1.000, 0.000) is 1.414
```

###### Note
Observe the spaces given in the output format. When practising at home,
it makes no difference but in the labs, the output should match exactly
as specified in the format.

## General Rules
Upto 20% marks will be allotted for good programming practice. These
include:

* Comments: for non trivial parts of code
* Indentation: align your code properly

---

Write a C Program to calculate the area of a triangle formed by the
three points `(a, b)`, `(a, 0)` and `(0, b)`, where the coordinates
are float and are given by the user. The output should be rounded
to four decimal places.

INPUT Format: a b are given in a line
OUTPUT Format: The area of (a, b), (a, 0) and (0, b) is A

##### Test Cases

###### Test Case 1

``` c
Input  : 1 1
Output : The area of (1.0000, 1.0000), (1.0000, 0) and (0, 1.0000) is 0.5000
```

###### Note
Observe the spaces given in the output format. When practising at home,
it makes no difference but in the labs, the output should match exactly
as specified in the format.

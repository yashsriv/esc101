Write a program to calculate the amount of change in Kinetic Energy(KE).
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has vy virtue if its motion. A change
in Kinetic Energy is calculated by:

```
KE = m(v1^2 - v2^2)/2
```

where `m` represents the mass of the body, `v1` represents the initial velocity
of the body and `v2` represents the final velocity of the body. Your program
should read `m`, `v1` and `v2` as floating point input and output the change
in Kinetic Energy upto 3 decimal places.

##### Test Cases

###### Test Case 1

``` c
Input  : 10 1.5 4.8
Output : 103.950
```

###### Test Case 2

``` c
Input  : 10 1.5 1.5
Output : 0.000
```

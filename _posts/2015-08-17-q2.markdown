Write a program to calculate the simple interest. `Simple
Interest (SI)` is the money paid by the borrower to the lender,
based on the `Principal Amount (P)`, `Interst Rate(R)` and the
`Time Period(T)`. Simple Interest is calculated by:

`SI = PTR/100`

Your program should input P followed by T followed by R.
All values are of type `float`. Output value of SI rounded
up to three decimal places.

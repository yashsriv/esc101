Write a C Program to calculate the amount of change in potential
energy(PE). Potential Energy is the energy stored by an object by
virtue of it position

A change in potential energy is calculated by:

```
PE = mg(h2 - h1)
```
where `m` represents the mass of the body, `g` represents gravitational
field strength, `h1` represents the initial height of the body and
`h2` represents the final resting height of the body.

Your program should read `m`, `g`, `h1` and `h2` as floating input, and
output the change in potential energy upto 3 decimal places.

##### Test Cases

###### Test Case 1

``` c
Input  : 6 9.8 1.5 9.5
Output : 470.400
```

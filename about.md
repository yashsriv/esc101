I am a sophomore in the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. In my first semester,
I had `ESC101A` and the greatest problem we faced was the absence of questions for
the particular lab week. I was in the Monday batch and I went for the labs unprepared
for the level/type of questions. This archive was an endeavour by me and my friends
so that the other batch won't face those difficulties.

This is just a set of practise problems before the particular lab instead of after.
In order to prevent plagiarism, I won't be releasing the solutions. Feel free to contact
me or your academic mentors in case of any doubts. **Please refrain from posting solutions
yourself in the comments or in some other way otherwise I might have to pull down this repository**

If I am breaking in any rule by hosting this online, please inform me and I will
take this down immediately.

Cheers!!
